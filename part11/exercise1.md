I worked on an Android application for a class project with Java. Some of the tools that we used, such as linting, were already built in to our IDE (Android Studio/Intellij). JUnit seems like a popular testing library, along with Mockito, Karate, and more. Android Studio uses Gradle for the build process, and it made our CI experience simpler.
Alternatives to GitHub Actions for a CI setup include Azure DevOps, GitLab. Firebase and GitHub actions work well together if you are using Firebase Hosting for a web app - deploying your code to the main branch will trigger a GitHub Action that tells Firebase to deploy and host your new changes.
Like most small-to-medium sized applications, our app would have been well-suited for a cloud-based environment. This was decided by the small scope of our app, and the tools that we used were already cloud-based (GitHub, Firebase). If we had used a dedicated server to host an API, then self-hosting may have made more sense for us.
